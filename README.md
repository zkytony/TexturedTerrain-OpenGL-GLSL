TexturedTerrain-OpenGL-GLSL
===========================

A rotating terrain with texture. Build while self-studying OpenGL and GLSL via books

### Some reflection

After self-studying the OpenGL for more than 1 month, I finally can do something more exciting.  
Learning OpenGL is not easy, yet I still want to move on because of my interest to create some  
great 3D graphics and even games.  

### About the data files

The `heightmap.raw` and `grass.tga` are files from the material of the book *Beginning OpenGL  
Game Programming* (for OpenGL 3).  

### Note

The .exe file will run on Windows and Linux (Tested)

Project made in September 2014
